# LabVIEW-code-for-Recording-FLIR-Blackfly-videos
A simple and straight forward LabVIEW code for streaming and saving video from FLIR Blackfly cameras. 

1. The software (e.g. Spinnaker) provided by the FLIR company will occupy too much network or memory when running at a high framerate. This phenomenon will result in the frame missing. 

1. This LabVIEW code can speed up the frame saving process. The verified highest frame rate is 200 f/s without losing any frames.

1. There are several Codec that can be chosen. You need to choose the best one fitting your configuration.

1. You also need to adjust the Number of Images (which is the frame rate) in the code.
